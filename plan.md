## Detailed Plan for Cloning akwantuoexpressgh.com

### 1. Project Overview
We will build a fully functional static clone of akwantuoexpressgh.com using the existing Next.js setup with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. The clone will feature:
- A Home page with a Hero banner and services overview.
- Additional pages: About, Services, Package Tracking, and Contact.
- A shared layout with Header and Footer components.
- A modern, responsive UI that uses clean typography, spacing, and color schemes.
- Robust error handling with image fallback mechanisms and form validations.

### 2. File Dependency Analysis
Before starting the implementation, review these files:
- **next.config.ts** – Confirm project configuration.
- **tsconfig.json** – Validate TypeScript settings.
- **src/app/globals.css** – Update global styling.
- **Existing shadcn/ui Components** in `src/components/ui/` – Leverage reusable UI components.
- **package.json** – Ensure required dependencies (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS) are present.

*If any of these files are missing or if additional dependencies are required, the plan will be re-evaluated and adjusted accordingly.*

### 3. Layout and Global Files

#### a. `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Steps:**
  1. Create (or update) `src/app/layout.tsx` to act as the root layout.
  2. Import the Header and Footer components.
  3. Wrap the application’s `{children}` with the Header at the top and Footer at the bottom.
  4. Set `<html lang="en">` and `<body>` with Tailwind base classes (e.g., `bg-gray-50`, `text-gray-900`).

#### b. `src/app/globals.css`
- **Steps:**
  1. Enhance the global styles to include the brand’s typography, container widths, and responsive utility classes.
  2. Define custom color schemes and spacing that match a corporate courier design.

### 4. Shared UI Components

#### a. Header Component (`src/components/Header.tsx`)
- **Steps:**
  1. Create a new file `src/components/Header.tsx`.
  2. Implement a semantic `<nav>` with a list of links: Home, About, Services, Track, and Contact.
  3. Style using Tailwind CSS for a modern look and include a responsive mobile menu (text-based, no external icons).
  4. Ensure accessibility via proper ARIA attributes.

#### b. Footer Component (`src/components/Footer.tsx`)
- **Steps:**
  1. Create `src/components/Footer.tsx`.
  2. Include company information, navigation links, and contact details.
  3. Style similarly with Tailwind CSS for consistent spacing and typography.

#### c. Hero Component (`src/components/Hero.tsx`)
- **Steps:**
  1. Create `src/components/Hero.tsx` to encapsulate the Home page banner.
  2. Use an `<img>` tag for the background with:
     - `src="https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=High+quality+corporate+courier+service+banner"`
     - A detailed `alt` attribute (e.g., "High quality corporate courier service banner displaying modern design and professional layout").
     - An `onError` handler to load a fallback image if needed.
  3. Overlay headline text and a call-to-action button with modern typography and spacing.

### 5. Page Implementations

#### a. Home Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- **Steps:**
  1. Build the main home page that imports the Hero component.
  2. Create a section below the Hero to display a grid of service overview cards. Leverage shadcn/ui card components if applicable.
  3. Ensure responsive layout and modern spacing for a clean interface.

#### b. About Page (`src/app/about/page.tsx`)
- **Steps:**
  1. In `src/app/about/`, create `page.tsx`.
  2. Write sections describing the company’s mission, vision, and history with engaging copy.
  3. Optionally include a placeholder image:
     - `src="https://placehold.co/800x600?text=Modern+corporate+office+interior"`
     - With an accurate alt text and an onError fallback.
  4. Style with Tailwind CSS to maintain consistency with other pages.

#### c. Services Page (`src/app/services/page.tsx`)
- **Steps:**
  1. In `src/app/services/`, create `page.tsx`.
  2. List offered services (e.g., Express Delivery, Parcel Services, COD Options) using a grid or list of cards.
  3. Apply hover effects and transition animations using Tailwind for modern user feedback.

#### d. Package Tracking Page (`src/app/track/page.tsx`)
- **Steps:**
  1. In `src/app/track/`, create `page.tsx`.
  2. Build a simple form with an input field for a tracking number and a button to submit.
  3. Implement client-side validation (using HTML `required` attribute and simple state logic) to display error messages if the input is empty.
  4. Show static, simulated tracking details upon submission.

#### e. Contact Page (`src/app/contact/page.tsx`)
- **Steps:**
  1. In `src/app/contact/`, create `page.tsx`.
  2. Design a contact form with inputs for Name, Email, and Message.
  3. Include form validation using native HTML validations.
  4. On form submission, statically display a success message (no backend submission required).

### 6. Error Handling and Fallbacks

- Create a 404 error page: `src/app/not-found.tsx` that presents a friendly message and a link to return home.
- For any image components (e.g., Hero and About pages), add an `onError` attribute to switch to a fallback placeholder if the image fails to load.
- Use try-catch in client-side form submission handlers (where applicable) to capture unexpected errors and notify users appropriately.

### 7. Testing and Validation

- **Local Testing:**
  - Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
  - Verify that all navigation links (Header) correctly route to Home, About, Services, Track, and Contact pages.
  - Confirm that each page renders correctly and is fully responsive.
  - Test image error handling by simulating a broken image source.
  - Check form validations on the Tracking and Contact pages.
- **Validation Protocol:**
  - Use browser testing to ensure UI elements, responsiveness, and form behaviors meet expectations.

### 8. Code Quality and Best Practices

- Ensure all new components and pages have complete TypeScript typings.
- Adhere to ESLint configurations for consistent code style.
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility.
- Keep CSS modular and leverage Tailwind’s utility-first approach to maintain brevity and clarity in design.

### 9. Additional Considerations

- Leverage any reusable shadcn/ui components already present (such as Card or Alert components) to keep consistency.
- Continuously check that every dependent file (especially global and layout files) is integrated before committing further changes.
- Update the project’s README.md to document the new pages and component structure if necessary.

## Summary
- Created a new root layout in `src/app/layout.tsx` that wraps pages with Header and Footer components.
- Developed modern, responsive UI components (Header, Footer, Hero) styled with Tailwind CSS.
- Implemented static pages for Home, About, Services, Package Tracking, and Contact, simulating realistic content.
- Integrated robust error handling, including image fallbacks and form validations.
- Ensured semantic markup and TypeScript best practices across all new components and pages.
- Validated all changes locally for correct navigation, responsiveness, and error-free functionality.
